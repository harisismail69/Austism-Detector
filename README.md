# Austism-Detector
This is a project based on machine learning using numpy and pandas in python.
The dataset was imported from kaggle.
The project is tested well and can identify if youre autistic or not by looking at you picture!
Haris: added the first commit as he implimented the machine learning model.
Mahad: added the second commit when he added the GUI user interface to the code using tkinter.
